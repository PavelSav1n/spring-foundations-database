#(boolean) switches the feature on and off and is vendor independent
spring.jpa.generate-ddl=false

#(enum) is a Hibernate feature that controls the behavior in a more fine-grained way.
# You can set spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto explicitly and the standard Hibernate property values are
# none, validate, update, create-drop.
# Spring Boot chooses a default value for you based on whether it thinks your database is embedded (default create-drop) or not (default none).
# An embedded database is detected by looking at the Connection type: hsqldb, h2 and derby are embedded, the rest are not.
# Be careful when switching from in-memory to a 'real' database that you don't make assumptions about the existence of the tables and data in the new platform.
# You either have to set ddl-auto explicitly, or use one of the other mechanisms to initialize the database.
#
# In addition, a file named import.sql in the root of the classpath will be executed on startup.
# This can be useful for demos and for testing if you are careful, but probably not something you want to be on the classpath in production.
# It is a Hibernate feature (nothing to do with Spring).
